# CinemaBookingGUI
This project creates a cinema GUI using JavaFX. Our project's idea was to create a GUI for a system that displays the most watched and liked movies in cinemas and feature them again in our cinema. 

When a user enters the system, they are prompt to sign up and create a username and password or log in with their already existing ones. If the user creates a new account, then they are prompted to log in. Once the log in is succesful and the user credentials are true, a ne window opens displaying multiple movies for the user to choose from. After the user chooses a specific movie, a new window pops-up with the discription of their movie choice. If the user decides to book that movie, the booking window appears with the time slots available, category of the hall, number of seats available, and number of seats that the user would like to reserve. After the user fills all of the above details, they should choose to confirm the booking. Else, if the user decides to delete their booing before closing the window, they can choose the "Delete" button option and their booking details will be deleted.
